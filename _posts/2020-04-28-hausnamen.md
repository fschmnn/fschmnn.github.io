In small villages like the one I grow up in, it is often common to refer to people not by there sur- or given name but rather their so called "hausname". Those names are bound to the place a person lives and are often derived from a job. Unfortunatley they are dying out so to preserve them as much as possible I created this map that contains the ones I could find for Mudau, Langenelz and Laudenberg
