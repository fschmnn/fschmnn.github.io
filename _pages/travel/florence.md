## INAF Acetri in Florence

I recently visited a collaborator in Florence and stayed there for 2 weeks. The city strikes a nice balance between order and organization of the north and the excellent food of the south. But the main attraction is of course the unfathomable cultural wealth. As the birthplace of the Renaissance, the city is stuffed with masterpieces from all the greats. The Uffizi Gallery is a must see, and so is Michelangelo's David (unfortunately the otherwise less impressive Galleria dell'Accademia). The former wealth and power of the city is evident in the entire architecture of the old city. Here are some things to see and eat.
