Here is an overview of the things that I have worked on over the last years

## Observing Metallicity Enrichment Across Galaxy Disks

I am currently doing my PhD in the [Baryon Cycle in Nearby Galaxies](https://wwwstaff.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/kkreckel/) group of Kathryn Kreckel. 
* PNLF distances for 19 galaxies observed by PHANGS–MUSE ([link](/pnlf)).
* Stellar associations powering Hɪɪ regions ([link](/cluster)).

## Self enrichment in feedback regulated clouds

Before this I completed my Master in the [Star Formation Group](http://klessen.org/) of Ralf Klessen.

## Dynamic sterring of planetesimals

I did my Bachelor in the [Planet Formation Group](http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/) of Kees Dullemond.
