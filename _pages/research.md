Here is an overview of the things that I have worked on over the last years. You can find a list of publications [here](/research/publications).

## Characterizing ionizing sources with PHANGS–MUSE

I am currently doing my PhD in the [Baryon Cycle in Nearby Galaxies](https://wwwstaff.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/kkreckel/) group of Kathryn Kreckel. In my work I combine different state-of-the art telescopes like MUSE/VLT or *HST* to constraint the evolution of emission line nebulae. 
* PNLF distances for 19 galaxies observed by PHANGS–MUSE ([link](/research/pnlf)).
* Stellar associations powering Hɪɪ regions – I. Defining an evolutionary sequence ([link](/research/evolution)).
* Stellar associations powering Hɪɪ regions – II. Escape fractions ([link](/research/escape_fractions)).



## Previous work

### Self enrichment in feedback regulated clouds

Before this I completed my Master in the [Star Formation Group](http://klessen.org/) of Ralf Klessen.

### Dynamic stirring of planetesimals

I did my Bachelor in the [Planet Formation Group](http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/) of Kees Dullemond.
