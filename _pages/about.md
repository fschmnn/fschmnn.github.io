## About this site

After attending a website building workshop from my graduate school, I became intrigued by the idea of creating my own website. I then found a tutorial by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/) on how to build and host a website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and thought why not give it a try.

Consequently, I am a novice when it comes to html and css. This lead to a patchwork of adjustments that were based on various stackoverflow posts -- hopefully they will be replaced with better code in the future.
